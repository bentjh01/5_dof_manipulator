Version 0

This is a humble beginning for hopefully something great. 

## Requirements

-   Model a Universal Robotics Manipulator with at least 6 DOF
-   Perform forward and inverse kinematics
-   Perform an easy pick and place task

Simulator used: Gazebo

## Plan
1. Choose a manipulator
1.1 Obtain URDF file
2. Set up simulation environment in Gazebo and ROS2
3. Set up movement software to do all the movement
4. Do a pick and place problem.
